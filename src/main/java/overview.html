    <P>BUbiNG is a high-speed distributed crawler. BUbiNG agents coordinate autonomously to download data from the web.

    <h2>Configuring your hardware</h2>
    
    <p>BUbiNG requires a number of features from your system.
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
    <li>If you want to run multiple agents, your network must be configured so that communication is possible. The default BUbiNG JGroups
    configuration file (that can be found in BUbiNG's jar under the name <samp>jgroups.xml</samp>) uses multicast over UDP, so you must be sure that a multicast route is set up. Please read the JGroups documentation
    to find how to set up the route and check that it works. 
    <p>You can specify an alternate JGroups configuration file using the JVM
    property {@value it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent#JGROUPS_CONFIGURATION_PROPERTY_NAME}.
    <li>Your system must be configured so that a large number of processes and files are allowed. Under linux, we use
    <pre>
	* - nofile 65536
	* - nproc  32768
    </pre>
    as a setup in <samp>limits.d</samp> (or equivalent configuration directory).
    <li>A number of system configurations (typically set in <samp>/etc/sysctl.d</samp>, say by creating a file <samp>/etc/sysctl.d/bubing</samp>) must be altered:
    <pre>
# increase TCP max buffer size settable using setsockopt()
net.core.rmem_max = 8388608
net.core.wmem_max = 8388608

# increase conntrack size (or remove iptables modules)
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 1048576
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_buckets = 16386

# Wait a maximum of 5 * 2 = 10 seconds in the TIME_WAIT state after a FIN, to handle
# any remaining packets in the network. 
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_fin_wait = 5
net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait = 5

# No protection from SYN flood attack (to run proxy tests)
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0

# Disable packet forwarding.
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

# Increase system file descriptor limit. Generally, set this to 64 * R, where
# R is the amount of RAM in MB your box has (minus a buffer?)
fs.file-max = 262144

# Send the first keepalive time after 60 seconds
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 60

# Timeout broken connections faster (amount of time to wait for FIN)
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30

# Let the networking stack reuse TIME_WAIT connections when it thinks it's safe to do so
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1

# Don't Log Spoofed Packets, Source Routed Packets, Redirect Packets 
net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 0

# Make more local ports available 
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024 65000
    </pre>
    <p>The above file is sourceable with <samp>sysctl</samp>.
    <li>You must be sure that either you are using a resilient DNS server that is going to sustain your request rate, or
    run locally a recursive name server. This is the best practice, because BUbiNG is going to require million of resolutions
    and will cache them internally. Thus, your DNS server can have a quite small cache. Our settings for <samp>bind9</samp> are
    as follows:
    <pre>
	allow-query     { localhost; };
	recursion yes;

	/* These must be coordinated with internal DNSJava settings. */
	max-cache-size 10000;
	max-cache-ttl 3600;
	max-ncache-ttl 60;
    </pre>
    <p>Moreover, we run bind with the <samp>-4</samp> option to avoid IPv6 resolution of each host and
    with the <samp>-U 8</samp> option to avoid the constant logging about the maximum number of FD events.

	<li>The file system should be set up for performance. If you have an <samp>ext4</samp> partition, we
	suggest to use the <code>tune2fs</code> utility to set the <samp>journal_data_writeback</samp> option, and to mount
	the partition using the options <samp>noatime</samp> and <samp>data=writeback</samp>.

	<li>If you intend to access SSL sites with strong security, you must download and install the
	Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.
    </ul>

   
   <p>To check that your system is properly configured, it is essential that a number of trial runs are performed using the
   {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.test.NamedGraphServerHttpProxy} in random mode. For instance,
   <pre>
   java -Xmx4G -server it.unimi.di.law.bubing.test.NamedGraphServerHttpProxy -s 100000000 -d 50 -m 3 -t 1000 -D .0001 -A1000 - &
   </pre>
	will start the proxy using 100 million hosts, average page degree 50, average depth 3, 1000 threads and a 0.01% pages being
	broken (connect or read timeouts). By starting BUbiNG with the configuration option <samp>proxyHost=localhost</samp> (the
	port, 8080, is understood) you can test that your memory and system settings are satisfactory without using any network
	bandwidth.
   
    
    <h2>Configuring BUbiNG</h2>

	<p>BUbiNG uses a <em>configuration file</em> to set up its internal values. Such values are fully documented
	in {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration}; the name of the keys are derived by reflection from 
	the field names. Default values are annotated using the {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration.OptionalSpecification}
	annotation in {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration}. This is an example configuration file:
    <pre>
rootDir=crawl-eu
parsingThreads=64
dnsThreads=50
fetchingThreads=512
fetchFilter=true
scheduleFilter=( SchemeEquals(http) or SchemeEquals(https) ) and HostEndsWithOneOf(.ad\,.al\,.at\,.be\,.bg\,.ch\,.cz\,.de\,.dk\,.ee\,.es\,.eu\,.fi\,.fo\,.fr\,.gb\,.gr\,.hr\,.hu\,.ie\,.im\,.is\,.it\,.li\,.lt\,.lu\,.lv\,.mc\,.md\,.me\,.nl\,.no\,.pl\,.pt\,.ro\,.se\,.si\,.sk\,.sm\,.uk\,.va) and not PathEndsWithOneOf(.axd\,.xls\,.rar\,.sflb\,.tmb\,.pdf\,.js\,.swf\,.rss\,.kml\,.m4v\,.tif\,.avi\,.iso\,.mov\,.ppt\,.bib\,.docx\,.css\,.fits\,.png\,.gif\,.jpg\,.jpeg\,.ico\,.doc\,.wmv\,.mp3\,.mp4\,.aac\,.ogg\,.wma\,.gz\,.bz2\,.Z\,.z\,.zip) and URLShorterThan(2048) and DuplicateSegmentsLessThan(3)
followFilter=true
parseFilter=( ContentTypeStartsWith(text/) or PathEndsWithOneOf(.html\,.htm\,.txt) ) and not IsProbablyBinary()
storeFilter=( ContentTypeStartsWith(text/) or PathEndsWithOneOf(.html\,.htm\,.txt) ) and not IsProbablyBinary()
schemeAuthorityDelay=10s
ipDelay=2s
socketTimeout=60s
connectionTimeout=60s
fetchDataBufferByteSize=200K
cookiePolicy=compatibility
cookieMaxByteSize=2000
userAgent=BUbiNG (+http://law.di.unimi.it/BUbiNG.html)
userAgentFrom=youremail@yourdomain.com
robotsExpiration=1h
responseBodyMaxByteSize=2M
digestAlgorithm=MurmurHash3
startPaused=false
workbenchMaxByteSize=512Mi
parserSpec=HTMLParser(MurmurHash3)
keepAliveTime=1s
    </pre>
	<p>Note that almost all these properties are modifiable at runtime using the JMX interface.

	<p>There are two main activities related to the preparation of configuration files:
	<dl>
	<dt>Choosing your filters</dt><dd>Every phase of BUbiNG's activity is controlled by a filter that you can specify using boolean operations
	and atoms from {@link it.unimi.di.law.warc.filters}.
	<dt>Sizing the various component</dt><dd>BUbiNG will use a constant amount of memory for its activities, except for storing host information, for which it
	assumes to have enough core memory. The shown values are a good choice for a 64 GiB machine.
   	</dl>
    
    <h2>Starting a crawl</h2>

	<p>First of all, we suggest to run as root the command <samp>sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/bubing</samp> (where the file <samp>bubing</samp> contains the settings discussed before)
	as in our experience some of the parameters turn out to be not correctly set after boot, even in included in <samp>/etc/sysctl.d</samp>. 

	<p>A BUbiNG is started using the {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent} class, as in:
	<pre>
java -server -Xss256K -Xms20G -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC  \
	-XX:+UseTLAB -XX:+ResizeTLAB -XX:NewRatio=4 -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=15 -XX:+CMSParallelRemarkEnabled \
	-verbose:gc -Xloggc:gc.log -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution \
	-XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime \
	-XX:+PrintSafepointStatistics -XX:PrintSafepointStatisticsCount=1 \
	-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.0.20 \
	-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true \
	-Djgroups.bind_addr=192.168.0.20 \
	-Dlogback.configurationFile=bubing-logback.xml \
	-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
	it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent -h 192.168.0.20 -P eu.properties -g eu agent -n 2>err >out
	</pre>

	<p>The JVM options are of course just an example for a 64-core, 64 GiB hardware, and should be customized. It is
	important, however, that the thread stack size (<samp>-Xss</samp>) is set to a small value (as BUbiNG uses
	thousands of threads).
	
	<p>The IP address specified will be
	used for JGroups and JMX communication: if you have an internal high-speed interface, this is the place to use it. Otherwise,
	just use the standard IP address of the machine. This crawl will use a property file named <samp>eu.properties</samp>, start an
	agent with name <samp>agent</samp> part of a crawl group named <samp>eu</samp>. <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a>
	will be configured by the file <code>bubing-logback.xml</code> (see below).
	
	<p>In the standard BUbiNG setup, agents 
	in the same crawl groups coordinates autonomously using consistent hashing, so if you want to perform a multi-agent crawl
	you must just be sure to have properly configured your hardware and JGroups so they work together,
	and <strong>give each agent a different name</strong>. A simple way to check
	that this is true is to start the crawl in pause mode, check from the logs that all agents are visible to each other,
	and then start the crawl.

	<p>Note that if you use multiple agents you have no guarantee that the politeness {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#ipDelay IP delay}
	will be respected, as multiple agents might crawl the same IP in parallel. To reduce pressure on IP addresses with a large
	number of hosts, if you have many agents you can try to tune the {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#ipDelayFactor IP delay factor}.
	
	<p>We use <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> for logging. We suggest a separate log for messages above the
	WARN level, to be able to find errors quickly. The file used in the command above could be as follows (assuming you want to write your logs in <samp>/tmp</samp>): 
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;configuration>
  &lt;appender name="all" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    &lt;file>/tmp/bubing.log&lt;/file>
    &lt;encoder>
      &lt;pattern>%d %r %p [%t] %logger{1} - %m%n&lt;/pattern>
    &lt;/encoder>
    &lt;rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
      &lt;maxHistory>100&lt;/maxHistory>
      &lt;FileNamePattern>/tmp/bubing.%d{yyyy-MM-dd_HH}.log&lt;/FileNamePattern>
    &lt;/rollingPolicy>
  &lt;/appender>
  &lt;appender name="warn" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
    &lt;file>/tmp/bubing.warn&lt;/file>
    &lt;encoder>
      &lt;pattern>%d %r %p [%t] %logger{1} - %m%n&lt;/pattern>
    &lt;/encoder>
    &lt;filter class="ch.qos.logback.classic.filter.ThresholdFilter">
      &lt;level>WARN&lt;/level>
    &lt;/filter>
    &lt;rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
      &lt;maxHistory>100&lt;/maxHistory>
      &lt;FileNamePattern>/tmp/bubing.%d.warn&lt;/FileNamePattern>
    &lt;/rollingPolicy>
  &lt;/appender>
  &lt;root level="INFO">
    &lt;appender-ref ref="all"/>
    &lt;appender-ref ref="warn"/>
  &lt;/root>
  &lt;logger name="net.htmlparser.jericho" level="OFF"/>
  &lt;logger name="it.unimi.di.law.bubing" level="INFO"/>
  &lt;logger name="it.unimi.di.law.bubing.frontier.FetchingThread$DNSJavaClientConnectionManager" level="INFO"/>
  &lt;logger name="org.apache.http.impl.client" level="WARN"/>
  &lt;logger name="org.apache.http.wire" level="WARN"/>
&lt;/configuration>
</pre>
	
	<h2>Tuning the garbage collector</h2>
	
	<p>BUbiNG's object handling deeply violates the <em>weak generational hypothesis</em>, that is, the idea that most allocated objects
	die young. During a crawl, dozens (of even hundreds) of millions of small objects have a lifetime of minutes or hours, and then disappear. Using
	the default settings of the garbage collector leads to a constant promotion these objects to the old generation, causing frequent
	full collections that decrease progressively the crawl speed.
	
	<p>The settings suggested above modify radically the garbage collector behavior. One third of the available memory is allocated
	for new objects, and we try to delay tenuring as much as possible by swapping objects 
	between the <em>survivor spaces</em> the maximum possible number of times (15, as the counter has only four
	bits). Note that frequent minor collections have little impact
	on the crawler, as even during collections the operating system is filling socket buffers, flushing file buffers, handling memory mapping, etc.
	We also require dynamic thread-local allocation buffers, as the allocation needs of, say, fetching threads and parsing threads are very
	different.   
	
	<p>It is always a good idea to log garbage collection information (as suggested above)
	and to examine the resulting log using a tool like
	<a href="https://github.com/chewiebug/GCViewer">Chewiebug</a>. Ideally, you should see frequent minor collection, and
	small sets of objects promoted to the old generation.
	
	<p>The actual values of the parameter should be chosen in the following order:
	<ul>
	<li>you must decide the amount of heap, which should be as large as possible, considering that you will need
	to leave some memory for caching, memory-mapped files, etc. Running a simulated crawl for a few hundred million pages
	is a good idea, as it is difficult to estimate the actual space occupied by the JVM (e.g., there is a large amount of
	system memory used);
	<li>you must decide the ratio between the new and the old generation; in principle, the largest possible
	new generation (<samp>-XX:NewRatio=1</samp>) will give the highest throughput, but if you are low on memory you might
	end up with out-of-memory errors because of a too small old generation.
	</ul>
	
	<p>The last final judge of a correct configuration of the garbage collector is the stability of the crawling speed. 

	<h2>How BUbiNG uses memory</h2>
	
	<p>Once you have decided the amount of memory that you want to use for the crawler, you must decide how to divide this
	memory among BUbiNG's components. Most of the memory used by BUbiNG can be divided as follows:
	
	<dl>
	<dt>The workbench</dt>
	<dd>The workbench keeps around the URLs (actually, the path+queries) that will be fetched in a short time. Depending on the number of threads, your
	network feed, etc., the workbench must be large enough to keep a few URLs for a number of hosts that is sufficient to saturate your bandwidth.
	We suggest starting with a large value (e.g., a gigabyte), check in the logs which percentage is actually used, and then lower the amount.</dd>
	<dt>The  {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.sieve sieve}</dt>
	<dd>The sieve keeps track of which URLs have ever been seen. The default implementation, {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.sieve.MercatorSieve}, accumulates
	URLs on disk and associated 64-bit fingerprints in RAM until it is full. Then, it flushes the data and generates a stream of ready URLs. The largest the sieve,
	the less flushes, the less I/O. The {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#sieveSize} should be multiplied by 12 to obtain approximately the amount of memory allocated.</dd>
	<dt>The fetching thread cache</dt>
	<dd>Each fetching thread must download data to a cache, whose size is determined by {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#fetchDataBufferByteSize}. The cache
	is transparently extended to {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#responseBodyMaxByteSize} using a file on disk, but too much disk access will slow
	down the crawler.</dd>
	<dt>The Bloom filter</dt>
	<dd>If you are using near-duplicate detection there is a large amount of memory used by the Bloom filter which keeps track of digests. The
	amount of memory used depends on {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#maxUrls} and
	{@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#bloomFilterPrecision}, and it is explained {@linkplain it.unimi.dsi.util.BloomFilter here}.</dd>
	<dt>Data associated to visit states</dt>
	<dd>This is a relatively small amount of data (less than one kilobyte) associated with each host currently visited. It consists in some metadata
	associated with the host, its cookies, and its <samp>robots.txt</samp> exclusion information. The size of the cookies can be controlled using a 
	{@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#cookieMaxByteSize}. This is the only part of the data accumulated by BUbiNG that might, over
	time, grow without bound.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>How BUbiNG uses disks</h2>
	
	<p>BUbiNG's activity requires a lot of disk I/O. Some of the I/O activity, like the flushes of the {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.sieve.MercatorSieve},
	are stop-of-the-world events and require no particular care. However, there are three activities that happen concurrently during the crawling:

	<dl>
	<dt>Accessing the disk queues</dt>
	<dd>Part of the URLs waiting to be crawled are <em>virtualized</em>&mdash;stored on disk. These URLs 
	are accessed frequently by memory mapping in a semi-random fashion; they are stored in {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#frontierDir}. 
	<dt>Dumping large responses</dt>
	<dd>Only the first {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#fetchDataBufferByteSize} bytes of a response are kept in main memory: the remaining
	part, up to  {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#responseBodyMaxByteSize} bytes, is dumped on a disk cache. There is one such cache
	per parsing thread, so the disk activity can be quite intensive. The caches are stored in {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#responseCacheDir}. 
	<dt>Storing data</dt>
	<dd>If you use a disk-based store, such as the default {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.store.WarcStore}, data will be continuously written in {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#storeDir}.</dd>
	<dt>Logging</dt>
	<dd>Depending on your <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/">Logback</a> configuration, logging can be quite I/O intensive.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<p>Ideally, these four activities should use different disks, and, if possible, {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.StartupConfiguration#frontierDir} should 
	live on solid-state storage.
		
    <h2>Following a crawl</h2>
    
    <p>There are two sources of information about the inner works of BUbiNG: JMX and the logs. Most internals of BUbiNG are
    modifiable at runtime using JMX, and looking at the logs reveals a lot information about what's going on. We suggest to
    regularly grep for <samp>ERROR</samp> and check standard error to catch problems at an early stage.
    
    <h2>Pausing, suspending or stopping a crawl</h2>
    
    <p>If you just want to pause a crawl, there is a JMX {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent#pause()} operation that will suspend crawling activity
    until {@link it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent#resume()} is invoked. Alternatively, you can 
    {@linkplain it.unimi.di.law.bubing.Agent#stop() stop the crawl}, which will cause the crawl state to be snapped to disk.
    At that point, the crawl can restart by launching the agent with the same configuration but without the <samp>-n</samp> option.
